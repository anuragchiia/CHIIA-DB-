## CHIIA DATABASE WORKFORCE STRUCTURE

### About our Project:
**The Chinese Investment in Australia (CHIIA) Database** is a public database of Mainland Chinese direct commercial investment in Australia. The CHIIA database publishes a detailed dataset of individual commercial transactions of all sizes, which aligns with complementary data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the American Enterprise Instituteâ€™s Global Investment Tracker. The CHIIA methodology produces data from transparent sources, using consistent classifications and methods, making it suitable for use in peer-reviewed academic publications. The CHIIA methodology is published online to inform those who use this data and allow our colleagues around the world to create similar databases for their country. The CHIIA database was created, and is maintained by the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Crawford School of Public Policy at The Australian National University.
